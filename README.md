# Forwarder Address Creator

This repository provides a solution for creating forwarder addresses, enabling users to efficiently bridge funds between different blockchain networks and currencies. With this tool, users can optimize their transactions, especially in scenarios where converting and bridging funds between specific smart contracts is necessary.

## Problem Statement

Consider a situation where a user needs to withdraw funds from an exchange platform like Kucoin. Kucoin charges a substantial fee for withdrawing funds to a specific blockchain network, for instance, Ethereum. However, the same asset is available on another network, such as Polygon, at a significantly lower fee. The challenge lies in efficiently transferring funds from one network to another while minimizing transaction costs.

## Solution Overview

The Forwarder Address Creator addresses this challenge by allowing users to create semi-custodial wallets with predefined approvals for specific smart contracts. These wallets act as intermediaries, facilitating the conversion and bridging of funds to desired destinations. Here's how it works:

- **Creation of Semi-Custodial Wallet**: Users can create wallets with prior approvals to specific smart contracts. These wallets serve as intermediaries for fund transfers.

- **Event Listening Mechanism**: The wallet is equipped with an event listener that triggers a bridge transaction upon receiving whitelisted funds. For instance, when funds in a whitelisted token like USDC are received on Polygon, the listener immediately initiates a bridge transaction to convert and transfer the funds to Ethereum USDC.

- **Flexible Payment Collections**: The solution is particularly useful for freelance payment collections where clients prefer to pay in different cryptocurrencies or across various blockchain networks. The forwarder addresses act as consolidation wallets, aggregating funds from different sources and sending them to pre-defined destinations.

## Features

- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes transaction costs by leveraging lower fees on alternative blockchain networks.
- **Whitelisted Token Support**: Supports whitelisted tokens for seamless conversion and bridging.
- **Event-Driven Automation**: Utilizes event listeners to automate fund transfers upon receiving whitelisted funds.
- **Flexible Payment Collection**: Enables collection of payments in various cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks.
